### Project Idea:
The NYU Poly community attracts a certain type of student. Most are immigrants and minorities within US. They commute long distance from 
places such as New Jersey, Long Island, Staten Island, and Upstate New York to save money. There comes a point, however, when they become 
fed-up with their everyday four hour commute and want to find apartments near the university and people to share the apartment with (to 
decrease the cost of rent). However, because the only time they spent in college is when taking classes, they don’t have much of a social 
life. So they have a difficult time finding roommates and a place to stay.

My idea is to built an application that lets you find potential roommates and apartments among the Poly community. If you already have an 
apartment and are seeking a roommate, you can find a roommate using this app. The app would be for grad and undergrad Poly students who 
are international students or commuters.
